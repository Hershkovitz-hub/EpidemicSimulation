# Epidemic Simulation

## Python for Neuroscientists (best) hackathon project

### The project will consist of 2 main features:

    1. GUI - Gal.
    The GUI will be responsible for presenting the main user-interface features of the project:
        a. I/O: Parameters selection by the user will be held by UI bars on the screen via the GUI feature.
        b. Visualisztion: All produced visualisztion of the project will be held by the GUI features.
    Having said that, the GUI should be able to (a) hold user's inputs and pass them to the simulation feature of the project, and (b) receive inputs from the simulation feature.
    2. Simulation - Tal & Noga.
    The simulation features of the project will be responsible for computing the features of each "player":
        a. The "world" of the project: as in, Virus's parameters, N people in the world, etc.
        b. The "people" of the project: as in, the state in which each node/subject of the simulation is at for every given time point.
    Having said that, the simulation should be able to (a) receive inputs from the GUI, and (b) send computation's results to the GUI.
